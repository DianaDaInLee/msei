                    <h2>The Challenge of External Validity</h2>
                    <p>Over the past two decades, social science has made major strides in identifying credible causal effects—but a critical question remains: do these findings travel? The Multi-Site Experiment Initiative (MSEI) tackles the challenge of external validity head-on by making large-scale, cross-national experimentation accessible and scalable. Through a fully funded survey infrastructure spanning 10 countries, MSEI enables researchers to field coordinated multi-site experiments that generate comparable evidence across diverse contexts. By lowering the barriers to collaboration and scale, MSEI accelerates the production of transparent, generalizable knowledge—and pioneers a new frontier in meta-science on when and where experimental findings hold.</p>

                    <h2>What Makes MSEI Unique</h2>
                    <p>Our initiative stands out in both its scale and its design. We combine purposive and randomized sampling to deliberately select a diverse set of research topics—from across all subfields and spanning expectations of both high and low cross-country heterogeneity—as well as experimental sites that include both well-studied and underexplored countries. To maximize learning over time, sites are randomly re-selected each year, allowing us to sequentially identify the most informative contexts while expanding global coverage.</p>
