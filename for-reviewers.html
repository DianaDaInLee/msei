                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is expected of MSEI reviewers?</h3>
                        <p>Reviewers are expected to provide thorough, constructive evaluations of proposals based on the published criteria: theoretical contribution, methodological rigor, feasibility, suitability for cross-national comparison, and potential to advance understanding of external validity.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How many proposals will I review?</h3>
                        <p>Typically, reviewers are assigned 3-5 proposals per review cycle, depending on the total number of submissions and reviewer availability.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long do I have to complete reviews?</h3>
                        <p>Reviewers are given approximately 3-4 weeks to complete their reviews. The specific deadline will be communicated when assignments are made.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is there compensation for reviewers?</h3>
                        <p>Reviewers receive an honorarium for their service, with details provided upon invitation to serve on the review panel.</p>

                    <h2>Review Process</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the review format?</h3>
                        <p>Reviews include both numerical ratings on key criteria and written comments providing substantive feedback. Reviewers should address strengths, weaknesses, and specific suggestions for improvement.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are reviews double-blind?</h3>
                        <p>Reviews follow a single-blind process: reviewers know the identity of applicants, but applicants do not know reviewer identities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What happens if I have a conflict of interest?</h3>
                        <p>Reviewers must disclose any conflicts of interest (e.g., current collaborators, advisors/advisees, institutional colleagues) and will be reassigned proposals as needed. When in doubt, disclose potential conflicts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will there be a panel discussion?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, after individual reviews are submitted, the review panel meets (virtually) to discuss proposals, reconcile ratings, and make final recommendations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What are the main evaluation criteria?</h3>
                        <p>Proposals are evaluated on:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> Significance of research question and expected scholarly impact</li>
                                <li><strong>Methodological Rigor:</strong> Quality of experimental design, measurement, and analysis plan</li>
                                <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Practicality of implementation across multiple countries</li>
                                <li><strong>Cross-National Suitability:</strong> Appropriateness for comparative analysis</li>
                                <li><strong>External Validity Contribution:</strong> Potential to advance understanding of when/where effects travel</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How should I evaluate proposals from fields outside my expertise?</h3>
                        <p>Panel composition ensures each proposal receives evaluations from both field specialists and methodological experts. Focus your review on aspects within your expertise (e.g., experimental design, cross-national feasibility) while noting areas outside your primary knowledge.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I consider the diversity of selected proposals?</h3>
                        <p>Individual reviews should focus on proposal quality. The panel discussion will consider portfolio balance across topics, disciplines, and expected heterogeneity levels as a secondary consideration.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-section">

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are proposal materials confidential?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, all proposal materials are strictly confidential. Reviewers may not share, discuss, or use information from proposals outside the review process.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I share proposals with colleagues for input?</h3>
                        <p>No, proposals should not be shared with anyone not involved in the official review process without explicit permission from MSEI.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if I recognize the authors?</h3>
                        <p>This is expected in a single-blind process. Evaluate the proposal on its merits regardless of author identity, and disclose any conflicts of interest.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
